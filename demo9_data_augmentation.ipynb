    "\n",
    "### Acting as a Regularizer\n",
    "Regularization is necessary for deep learning models to generalize well to unseen data (i.e. test data), and it can be introduced into models through explicit methods such as adding a weighted $L_{1}$ or $L_{2}$ penalty, for example, to the loss function. However, regularization can also be introduced implicitly into the model through data augmentation. In previous course material we saw that a least squares problem with data augmentation is equivalent to an $L_{2}$ regularized least squares problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset $D=\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}^{m}_{i=1}$ consisting of $m$ datapoints, where $x_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ and $y_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can augment our data by adding Gaussian noise such that for each training point $x_{i}$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{X}_i = x_i + N_i \\text{, where } N_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,\\sigma^{2}I)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can construct $\\tilde{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times p}$ by stacking our $\\tilde{X}_i$ terms together and can construct our original design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times p}$ by stacking our $x_{i}$ vectors together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it can be shown that minimizing the expected least squares objective for the noisy (i.e. augmented) data matrix is equivalent to miniziming the least squares objective with $L_{2}$ regularization: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "   \\arg \\min_{w} \\mathbb{E}[\\|y - \\tilde{X}w\\|^2_{2}] = \\arg \\min_{w}\\frac{1}{m}\\|y - Xw\\|^2_{2} + \\lambda\\|w\\|^2_{2} \\text{, where } \\lambda = \\sigma^{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The above result proves the regularizing effect that data augmentation can have on a model. Think about how we can generalize the idea of adding random Gaussian noise from the least squares setting to a computer vision problem. To achieve a similar regularizing effect, one can add random Gaussian noise to each pixel of an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Consider an edge or a pattern that consistently appears near the center of an image in a subset of the training data. For example, this might be the stripes of a zebra consistently appearing in the center, due to the images of the zebra consistently being centered on the zebra. The model (i.e. CNN) will latch onto that edge or pattern as it is designed to do. Due to translational/equivariance invariance, the model should be able to detect if the zebra and its stripes were shifted around the image, thus providing the model with information to inform its prediction (ideally, that would be 'zebra').\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in reality, images are not always as clean-cut as the training examples in datasets such as CIFAR-10. The quality of the image could be poor (blurriness) resulting in the model poorly identifying features, or a glare in the picture that distracts the model from important patterns and edges that result in a correct classification. It might even be possible that the subset of zebra images are entirely centered on a docile zebra standing horizontally, meaning a rotated or 'active' zebra may result in a misclassification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, data augmentation during training provides a way of implicitly regularizing the model by artificially creating scenarios that could be realistically seen in the real world. These data augmentations force the model to adapt to these changes by relying less on exploiting patterns from idealized versions of images. By augmenting our data, we are approximating what our data looks like in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation is also an avenue for domain knowledge to be exploited to help produce more accurate while still robust models. Experts and scientists can provide encodings of what is important via domain emphasis by selecting data augmentations that accurately represent what the model may encounter post-training."
